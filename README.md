# Data Resources for IJM Data Community of Practice :nerd_face:
Hopefully some of these resources will educate, inspire, or just be flat out interesting to you. If you come across any others that you enjoy, feel free to add them!

## IJM Brand Files
* [Tableau brand file](Preferences.tps) - IJM Branding colors for Tableau
* [PowerBI brand file](Theme.json) - IJM Branding colors for PowerBI

## Currated curations
* [Data Elixr](https://search.dataelixir.com/) - great collection of what's happening in the data world and covers a wide range of topics. You can also sign up for the weekly newsletter. 
* [O'Reilly AI and Data](https://www.oreilly.com/emails/newsletters/) - another good collection of data articles. I find some overlap with Data Elixr, but can also be a bit more on the technical side.

## General Coding Training
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - lots of courses covering almost any coding topic you can think of. NA BI has purchased some pro licenses for their team, so they would be good to ask for reviews of their experience with it. 
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) - one of my all-time favorites due to the availability of datasets to play with and community of code posted so you can see how others approach these challenges. They also have dedicated courses as well, so lots to learn.

## Data Visualization
* [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/) - Nathan Yau is a master of data viz. He highlights the good and bad in examples he finds out in the media. He also covers some of his creative process when designing his own viz products, but those are behind a paywall if you want them.

## Machine Learning
* [Google Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - I really like this for beginners because it starts off with a "How to frame an ML problem" and then prepping data for actual analysis. Most ML training just jumps into nicely formatted data, which is just a cruel trick. 
* [Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - this is how I learned ML. Requires a bit of stats background, but fairly accessible to most. My one issue is that it uses Matlab/Octave for the coding assignments, which is super rare language for the general population, but you could use R or Python with the datasets instead.

## Data in Slavery
* [Delta 8.7](https://delta87.org/what-is-delta-8-7/) - UN organized group focused on measuring SDG 8.7 and using data to achieve the goal. You can signup for a newsletter for Delta 8.7 to keep up with how data is being used across the space. A subgroup, Code 8.7, is specifically focusd on bringing data science and tech to the problem of slavery and forced labor.  
* [Data used in Delta 8.7 Dashboards](https://i.unu.edu/media/cpr.unu.edu/attachment/5852/Data-dashboard-resources.pdf)
* [SDG Data Sets](https://sdgstoday.org/) - Contributed data sets from organizations all focused on measuring the SDGs.
