# data-resources
Curated collection of resources on all things data (analytics, coding, viz, etc.)

# Data Resources for IJM Data Community of Practice
Hopefully some of these resources will educate, inspire, or just be flat out interesting to you. If you come across any others that you enjoy, feel free to add them!

## Currated curations
* [Data Elixr](https://search.dataelixir.com/) - great collection of what's happening in the data world and covers a wide range of topics. You can also sign up for the weekly newsletter. 
* [O'Reilly AI and Data](https://www.oreilly.com/emails/newsletters/) - another good collection of data articles. I find some overlap with Data Elixr, but can also be a bit more on the technical side.

## Data Visualization
* [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/) - Nathan Yau is a master of data viz. He highlights the good and bad in examples he finds out in the media. He also covers some of his creative process when designing his own viz products, but those are behind a paywall if you want them.
